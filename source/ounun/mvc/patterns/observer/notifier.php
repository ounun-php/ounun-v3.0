 */

/**
 * A Base <code>INotifier</code> implementation.
 *
 * <b>MacroCommand, SimpleCommand, Mediator</b> and <b>proxy</b>
 * all have a need to send <b>Notifications</b>.
 *
 * The <b>INotifier</b> interface provides a common method called
 * <b>sendNotification</b> that relieves implementation code of
 * the necessity to actually construct <b>Notifications</b>.
 *
 * The <b>Notifier</b> class, which all of the above mentioned classes
 * extend, also provides an initialized reference to the <b>Facade</b>
 * Singleton, which is required for the convienience method
 * for sending <b>Notifications</b>, but also eases implementation as these
 * classes have frequent <b>Facade</b> interactions and usually require
 * access to the facade anyway.
 *
 * <b>NOTE:</b><br>
 * In the MultiCore version of the framework, there is one caveat to
 * notifiers, they cannot send notifications or reach the facade until they
 * have a valid multitonKey.
 *
 * The multitonKey is set:
 *  - on a Command when it is executed by the Controller
 *  - on a Mediator is registered with the View
 *  - on a Proxy is registered with the Model.
